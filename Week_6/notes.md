# Hey guys welcome to week 6ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³. 
## This week we are going to learn about searching algorithms

### Introduction to Searching Algorithms

Searching algorithms are fundamental techniques used to find specific elements within a data structure. They are essential in computer science and are used in various applications, from database queries to web searches.

#### [Types of Searching Algorithms](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/searching_algorithms.htm)

1. **Linear Search** [Video1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=246V51AWwZM) [Video2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSYQ1H9-Vks)
   - Simplest searching algorithm
   - Sequentially checks each element
   - Works on both sorted and unsorted arrays
   - Time Complexity: O(n)

2. **Binary Search** [Video1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFhxShGxHWc) [Video2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDKIpRe8GW4)
   - Works only on sorted arrays
   - Divides the search space in half at each step
   - Much faster than linear search
   - Time Complexity: O(log n)

3. **Jump Search** [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNOoyZ45SmQ)
   - Works on sorted arrays
   - Jumps ahead by fixed steps
   - More efficient than linear search
   - Time Complexity: O(âˆšn)

4. **Interpolation Search** [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF9iJEPegNc)
   - Works on sorted, uniformly distributed arrays
   - Uses interpolation formula to guess the position
   - Faster than binary search for certain cases
   - Time Complexity: O(log log n) average case

5. **Exponential Search** [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDVYtuWXgXE)
   - Works on sorted arrays
   - Finds range where element might be present
   - Uses binary search within that range
   - Time Complexity: O(log n)
