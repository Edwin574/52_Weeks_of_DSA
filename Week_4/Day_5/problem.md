# Count Unreachable Node Pairs in an Undirected Graph

## Problem Statement

You are given an **integer** `n` representing the number of **nodes** in an **undirected graph**, numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. 

You are also given a **2D integer array** `edges`, where `edges[i] = [a_i, b_i]` denotes that there exists an **undirected edge** between nodes `a_i` and `b_i`.

Your task is to **return the number of pairs** of different nodes that **are unreachable** from each other.

## **Examples**

### **Example 1**
#### **Input**
```python
n = 3
edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,2]]
