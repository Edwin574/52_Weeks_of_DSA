# Find the Center of a Star Graph

## Problem Statement

A **star graph** is an undirected graph with `n` nodes labeled from `1` to `n`, where there is exactly **one center node** connected to every other node, forming `n - 1` edges.

You are given a **2D integer array** `edges`, where each `edges[i] = [ui, vi]` represents an edge between nodes `ui` and `vi`. Your task is to determine the **center node** of the given star graph.

## Examples

### Example 1:
#### **Input:**
```plaintext
edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[4,2]]
