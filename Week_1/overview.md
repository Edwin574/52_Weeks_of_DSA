# Week 1 Overview: Data Structures and Algorithms

Welcome to Week 1 of our 52 Weeks of DSA journey! This week, we will be diving into a variety of problems that will help you strengthen your understanding of fundamental data structures and algorithms. Here's a brief overview of what we will be covering:

## Topics

1. **Palindrome Linked List**
    - Determine whether a singly linked list is a palindrome.

2. **2D-Array Hourglass Sum**
    - Explore 2D arrays by calculating the maximum hourglass sum in a 6x6 matrix.


3. **Closed Brackets String**
    - Develop a solution to determine if a string with brackets and jokers represents a proper sequence of parentheses.


4. **Move Zeroes**
    - Practice array manipulation by moving all zeroes to the end of the array while maintaining the relative order of non-zero elements.


5. **Linked Lists - Alternating Split**
    - Learn how to manipulate linked lists by splitting them into two smaller lists based on alternating elements.



## Goals

By the end of this week, you should be able to:
- Manipulate linked lists and arrays effectively.
- Solve problems involving 2D arrays.
- Handle strings with special characters and determine their validity.
- Identify and solve palindrome problems in linked lists.

Let's get started and have a productive week of coding!
