# 52-Weeks of DSA

Welcome to the **52-Week DSA Challenge** repository! This is a comprehensive DSA Challenge to help you master data structures and algorithms (DSA) and prepare for coding interviews at any company. The repository is beginner-friendly and progressively covers advanced topics over the course of one year.

### Weekly Folders
Each week has its own folder containing daily subfolders for the 5 working days (Day 1 to Day 5). Each daily folder contains:
- **`questions.md`**: The problem for the day with links.
- **`solutions/`**: Folder for participants' solutions, categorized by programming language.
  - Each contributor should add their solution in a file within the appropriate language folder. If multiple users use the same language, their solution files should all reside in the same language folder.

  - In your solution file briefly explain the algoritmic complexity of your solution 
- **`notes.md`**: Optional file for notes, tips, or explanations related to the day's topic.
- **`Readme.md`**: A file providing a summary of the week's topic, goals, and additional resources.
